title: Connection security vulnerability with schema sync
date: 2021-04-26
description: |
  pgsync drops connection parameters when syncing the schema with the
  --schema-first and --schema-only options. Some of these parameters may
  affect security. For instance, if sslmode is dropped, the connection
  may not use SSL. The first connection parameter is not affected.
